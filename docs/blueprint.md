# **App Name**: AgentVerse

## Core Features:

- Agent Tester: Agent Testing: Upload agent configurations and test them against predefined or custom scenarios. It works like a playground. The agent will receive a goal to execute, using the tool, and the interface allows you to step through the execution. This will highlight errors, performance bottlenecks and cost estimation.
- Tool Integrator: Tool Integration: Use generative AI as a tool, to test the interaction between your AI agent and MCP (message control protocol) tools, for any new AI agent frameworks.
- Dynamic UI: Dynamic Configuration: UI components that dynamically adapt to different agent frameworks and tool schemas.
- Scenario Editor: Scenario Management: Create, edit, and save testing scenarios, that include environment configuration, the goal or prompt to provide the agent, and acceptance criteria for agent success.
- Detailed logs: Detailed Logging: A detailed logging mechanism that captures every interaction step during the test, and shows intermediate outputs.
- Cost Analysis: Cost analysis: Estimate cost to operate agents using different tool configurations. As a LLM powered tool, provide budget guidance or alerts when agent costs exceed expectations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#667EEA) for a sense of intelligence and sophistication.
- Background color: Light gray (#F7FAFC) for a clean and modern feel.
- Accent color: Soft Purple (#A3AEDB) to highlight key interactive elements and actions.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts.
- Simple and modern icons.
- Grid-based layout for consistent spacing and alignment.
